SQL Data Analysis

Introduction

This repository showcases my journey in applying SQL to analyze datasets. It contains SQL scripts and resources for extracting insights, cleaning data, and generating reports. This project is designed to demonstrate practical SQL applications for data analysis and enhance my skills in working with databases.

Background

Data is a critical asset in today's world, and SQL is a fundamental tool for working with structured data. Through this project, I aimed to develop a deeper understanding of SQL techniques and their applications in solving real-world analytical problems. By working on this project, I explored various concepts such as data wrangling, aggregation, and advanced querying.

Tools I Used

Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL and PostgreSQL

Development Environment: VS Code

Datasets: Sample datasets provided in CSV and SQL formats

Extensions: SQL tools and plugins for code formatting and execution

The Analysis

Task 1: Identifying Top Customers by Sales

To identify the top-performing customers, I wrote a query that aggregated sales data by customer and sorted the results in descending order of total sales:

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;

This analysis highlighted the customers contributing the most revenue.

Task 2: Calculating Monthly Revenue

To track business performance over time, I calculated monthly revenue using the following query:

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month, SUM(total_amount) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

This provided insights into revenue trends and helped identify peak months for sales.

Task 3: Data Cleaning and Transformation

I performed data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. For instance:

DELETE FROM sales WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM (
        SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_id ORDER BY id) AS row_num
        FROM sales
    ) temp
    WHERE row_num > 1
);

This ensured the data's integrity and reliability for analysis.

What I Learned

The power of SQL for data analysis, from basic queries to advanced techniques like window functions and subqueries.

The importance of data cleaning and preparation for accurate insights.

How to use SQL to uncover trends and patterns in data effectively.

Best practices for organizing and documenting SQL scripts.

Conclusion

This project enhanced my skills in SQL and provided valuable experience in data analysis. I learned how to approach analytical problems methodically and gained confidence in using SQL to derive actionable insights. Moving forward, I plan to explore more complex datasets and integrate SQL with other tools like Python for advanced analytics.
